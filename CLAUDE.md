# CLAUDE.md

This file guides Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository. It documents what
**exists today**; the forward plan lives in `OS_PLAN.md`. When this file and the plan disagree
about how the code *currently works*, this file wins and the plan is stale — fix it.

## Project Overview

gatOS is a **standalone KSA mod** that runs a real, minimal **Alpine Linux** inside a **QEMU
microVM** subprocess. Players open terminal sessions into the guest through **purrTTY** — which
stays an unmodified terminal emulator, consumed only via its published `purrTTY.CustomShellContract`
extension point — over SSH. The whole point is to stop hand-writing terminal userland: real `apk`,
real shells, real pipes/jobs/pagers/editors, zero custom guest binaries.

Live KSA vehicle telemetry is exposed to the guest **as a filesystem**: a C#-implemented
**9P2000.L server** that the guest mounts at `/sim`, so the entire unix toolbox (`cat`, `watch`,
`tail -f`, `jq`, awk pipelines) becomes the game API surface. Persistence is qcow2 overlays, one
per save profile, on top of a pristine shipped base image.

The architecture and the research behind it are fixed in **`OS_ANALYSIS.md`** (options considered,
why QEMU won); **`OS_PLAN.md`** is the execution plan (milestones M0–M12, fine-grained tasks). Read
`OS_PLAN.md` Part 0 before starting any task — it defines the execution model, repo conventions,
and the decisions locked in (Part 1).

> **Sibling repo:** `../purrtty` is the structural reference (csproj/slnx/CI patterns) and the
> source of truth for the vendored contract assembly. KSA decompiled sources are under
> `thirdparty/ksa/`; the `ksa` skill documents the mod lifecycle and telemetry APIs.

## Current status (what is actually built)

**M0 — repository scaffold: DONE.** The solution, all 11 projects, shared build config, the logging
shim, `GatOsPaths`, the vendored purrTTY contract, and CI are in place and green.

**M1 — de-risking spike: DONE.** All three gates passed against a real Alpine 3.24 guest (kernel
6.18): 9p synthetic files `cat`/`tail -f`/Ctrl-C-Tflush from the kernel's v9fs client against a
hand-rolled C# 9P2000.L server; SSH.NET 2025.1.0 shell with **live resize** against dropbear; a
known-good QEMU invocation. The spike's throwaway code was deleted when M2 landed (per plan);
**`spike/NOTES.md` (committed) records the learnings and is REQUIRED READING before
M3/M4/M7/M8 work** — notably: i_size must be truthful (the analysis §3.6 fake-size advice is
wrong on ≥6.11 kernels), a read() completes only on buffer-full or two consecutive 0-byte Rreads,
and "growing-log" (`tail -f`) vs "blocking-event" (`cat`) synthetic files are two distinct models
the M7 VFS must support.

**M2 — guest image pipeline: DONE.** `guest/build-image.sh` reproducibly builds the guest from
pinned Alpine 3.24 mirrors — no setup-alpine, no openrc; busybox init runs the hand-written
`guest/rootfs-overlay/` (static slirp net 10.0.2.15, dropbear key-only, qemu-ga via wrapper,
`sim-mount` 9p supervisor driven by the `gatos.simport=<port>` kernel cmdline, 0/absent = idle).
Artifacts in `guest/out/` (never committed): partitionless-ext4 `base.qcow2` (zstd qcow2),
`vmlinuz-virt`, trimmed `initramfs-virt` (`features="base virtio ext4"`), `manifest.toml` (the
host boot contract: kernel cmdline, ssh user/key, host-key pin = sha256 hex of the raw key blob),
baked ed25519 session keypair, `sha256sums.txt`. Build needs root on Linux (macOS dev: Docker;
both documented in `guest/README.md`); a built-in smoke test (also `--smoke-only`) boots the
artifacts, checks `ssh 'echo ok'`, **verifies the host-key pin**, and powers off — measured cold
boot→sshd **5 s under TCG** on the dev Mac. `.github/workflows/guest-image.yml` builds and
publishes GitHub release `guest-v<N>` (N = `guest/GUEST_VERSION`); consumers obtain artifacts via
`guest/fetch-guest.{sh,ps1}` (checksum-verified, no-op when current).

**M3 — gatOS.Vm (QEMU lifecycle): DONE.** `VmHost` (`gatOS.Vm/VmHost.cs`) is the coalesced async
state machine (Stopped→Starting→Running→Stopping/Faulted): `EnsureStartedAsync` runs one shared
boot for concurrent callers (base install → overlay + `DiskLock` → 3 loopback ports → spawn →
SSH-banner readiness raced against process death; one retry on a hostfwd port clash), `StopAsync`
walks the shutdown ladder **QGA `guest-shutdown` → QMP `quit` → kill** and always releases the
disk lock; an unexpected exit while Running flips to Faulted (retryable) and frees the lock.
Supporting cast (all `gatOS.Vm/`, all game-free): `GatOsPaths`; `PortAllocator`; `QemuLocator`
(bundled `win-x64/` on Windows per D5, PATH + Homebrew prefixes on unix); `GuestManifest`
(Tomlyn-parsed `manifest.toml` — the host↔guest boot contract); `DiskManager`+`DiskLock`
(versioned `base-v<N>.qcow2` install, kernel/initrd/manifest/ssh-key under `disks/guest-v<N>/`,
overlays with **bare relative backing refs**, PID lock files with stale reclaim, never
`qemu-img commit`); `QemuCommandBuilder` (per-OS accel ladders `whpx|kvm|hvf→tcg`, **non-x64
hosts collapse to tcg**, `-cpu host` vs `max`, injectable `OperatingSystemFacts`); `QemuProcess`
(3 s survival window, `AccelFailureClassifier` + one forced-tcg retry, `logs/qemu-*.log`
retention ×5, 100-line stderr ring, minimal QMP quit); `ReadinessProbe` (reads the `SSH-` banner —
a bare TCP connect is meaningless, slirp accepts from t=0); `QgaClient` (0xFF-sentinel
`guest-sync-delimited` preamble, all failures soft). `IQemuProcess`/`IDiskManager`/`IQgaClient`
seams + an internal `VmHost` ctor (`InternalsVisibleTo`) make the state machine fake-testable;
`gatOS.Vm.Tests/Integration/` boots the real fetched guest. Measured on the dev Mac (TCG, worst
case): boot→Running→clean QGA stop ≈ 10 s end-to-end. CI installs QEMU, opens `/dev/kvm`, fetches
the pinned guest and runs the whole suite with `GATOS_IT=1`.

**M4 — gatOS.Ssh (the ICustomShell implementation): DONE.** `VmConnectionBroker`
(`gatOS.Ssh/VmConnectionBroker.cs`) owns the shared `VmHost` (disposing the broker stops the VM)
and hands out one **new connected `SshClient` per session**, pinning the guest host key against
the manifest sha256 (mismatch → `HostKeyMismatchException`; one retry on connection-refused).
`SshShellSession` (`gatOS.Ssh/SshShellSession.cs`) implements the vendored
`purrTTY.Core.Terminal.ICustomShell`: trivial ctor (purrTTY's registry probe-instantiates and
disposes, T0.5); `StartAsync` boots the VM lazily and opens an `xterm-256color` PTY at the launch
size (a pre-start resize wins; failures map to `CustomShellStartException` carrying
`VmStartException.UserMessage`); input flows through `ShellInputQueue` (bounded 1 MiB, dedicated
writer thread, overflow drops + logs once per episode — purrTTY's `PtyInputQueue` discipline;
the first write failure terminates the session); `NotifyTerminalResize` →
`ShellStream.ChangeWindowSize` (live SIGWINCH, verified in-guest); one `Terminate` path raises
`Terminated` exactly once (clean close 0; connection error / VM fault / write failure 1 —
sessions watch `VmHost.StatusChanged` for Faulted). **Stopping a session never stops the VM.**
Internal `IShellBroker`/`IShellChannel` seams (+ the `SshShellChannel` adapter owning the
client+stream pair) keep the session unit-testable without SSH.NET: `gatOS.Ssh.Tests` = 19
fake-driven unit tests + 2 `GATOS_IT=1` fixtures against the real guest (broker echo-ok +
tampered-pin rejection; full session: prompt, `stty size` 24 80, live resize → 30 120, `$TERM`,
two concurrent sessions on one VM, session stops leave the VM Running).

**M5 — upstream purrTTY changes: DONE** (in the **purrtty** repo, commits `9fb5e13`/`a56966a`).
T5.1: `purrTTY.GameMod/mod.toml` exports `purrTTY.CustomShellContract` + `purrTTY.Logging` over
the StarMap ALC (`[StarMap] ExportedAssemblies`) so gatOS's `ImportedAssemblies` (M6) resolves
purrTTY's loaded copies — one type identity, one shared `CustomShellRegistry.Instance`. T5.2:
the New Tab / New Window menus append custom shells registered by other mods, enumerating
`CustomShellRegistry.GetAvailableShells()` live per draw (probe-free; solves cross-mod
registration timing without a refresh hook), launching via
`ProcessLaunchOptions.CreateCustomGame(id)`. **Still pending: the purrTTY tip release cut**
(next push to purrtty `main`) — M6 in-game testing needs a purrTTY install carrying both changes.

**M6 — gatOS.GameMod (in-game integration): CODE DONE; T6.6/T6.7 in-game passes pending.**
`Mod` (`gatOS.GameMod/Mod.cs`) is the `[StarMapMod]` entry, a **partial class split on the
game-assembly boundary**: `Mod.cs` itself uses no KSA/Brutal types, so the project builds on CI
without the private game DLLs; the game-coupled half (`Game/Mod.Game.cs` + `Game/BrutalModLogger.cs`)
compiles only when `KSAFolder/KSA.dll` exists (csproj `KsaAssembliesPresent` gate) and is reached
through `partial void` seams (`InstallGameLogging`, `DrawGameUi`) whose calls drop out otherwise.
`OnFullyLoaded` (never throws): swap `ModLog` to a Brutal `LogCategory("gatOS")` sink — isolated in
`TryInstallGameLogging` so a load failure can't abort init, and `BrutalModLogger`'s ctor refuses
while `LogSystem.IsEnabled` is false (calls would silently no-op) — then resolve
`GatOsPaths.ModDir` from the entry assembly, `ModAssets.Validate()` (T6.2: manifest schema +
artifact files + `QemuLocator.Find()`, all problems folded into one `AssetStatus.Error` string),
`GatOsConfig.LoadOrCreate` (T6.3: Tomlyn 2.6 serializer, snake_case, clamp+log normalize, atomic
temp+rename save, first-run file with comment header; bad files → in-memory defaults, never
overwritten), build `VmHost`+`VmConnectionBroker` (**no boot**, D2), register shell `"gatos"`
(purrTTY absence detected after the fact: the contract assembly resolving from gatOS's own folder
means the vendored fallback loaded). `Unload` = `broker.DisposeAsync().AsTask().Wait(15 s)` (the
dispose is the 10 s-grace QGA→QMP→kill ladder). T6.4 diagnostics: `[ModMenuEntry("gatOS")]` menu
(Status/Start VM/Shut Down VM/Open Data Folder/Reset Disk…+confirm-modal) and an ImGui status
window (state, accel + WHPX DISM hint when tcg-on-Windows, ports, uptime, guest version, config,
newest qemu log — cached per `VmStatus` transition — fault reason, asset status, action note); all
actions `Task.Run`, draw code reads volatile state only (rule 5). Two load-order subtleties worth
keeping: game-typed *statics* live in a nested `Palette` class (field types resolve at type load;
`Mod` must load without game DLLs) and the partial impls are `NoInlining` so missing-assembly
faults hit the guarded call sites. **Verified 2026-06-12 by a headless smoke driving the deployed
dist** (LoadFrom + reflection): init, registration, registry-created session booting the real VM
(WHPX fail → auto TCG retry), echo + launch-size + live resize, session stop leaves VM Running,
2.2 s clean unload — see `docs/VALIDATION.md`. **Pending: T6.6 in-game pass** (needs the purrTTY
tip release with M5) **and T6.7** (WHPX-enabled run; `HypervisorPlatform` is off on the game
machine).

Everything past M6 is **not yet implemented** — the library projects (`NineP`, `SimFs`) hold
placeholder/skeleton types only — with one exception pulled forward: **T11.1 QEMU win-x64 bundle
tooling is DONE** (`tools/fetch-qemu.{ps1,sh}` populate `vendor/qemu/win-x64/` from the pinned
Weil installer; pin + trimmed file list live in `tools/qemu-win64-files.txt`, derivation helper
`tools/Get-QemuImportClosure.ps1`; see the T11.1 as-built note in `OS_PLAN.md`). On Windows,
headless tests resolve that vendored bundle via `QemuLocator.OverridePath` (`VendoredQemuSetup`
in `gatOS.Vm.Tests`/`gatOS.Ssh.Tests`), and `QemuLocator.Find()` throws the typed
`QemuNotFoundException` (not `InvalidOperationException`) when `GatOsPaths.ModDir` is unset, so
the test skip-gate works. The full `GATOS_IT=1` suite is verified green on the Windows 11 game
machine (TCG fallback — WHPX needs the off-by-default `HypervisorPlatform` Windows feature; guest
boot ≈ 7 s under TCG). Track real progress against the milestone table in `OS_PLAN.md` Part 3;
do not document planned code here as if it exists.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
dotnet build gatos.slnx                          # build the whole solution
dotnet test  gatos.slnx --nologo -v quiet        # full suite (5 test projects)
dotnet build gatOS.Vm                            # one project
dotnet build gatOS.GameMod                       # also deploys the mod folder (see below)
```

Every `gatOS.GameMod` build deploys the complete mod folder via its `CopyCustomContent`
target (T6.5): managed payload (all output DLLs except loader-supplied 0Harmony/StarMap.API),
mod.toml + deps.json, licenses, `guest/out/**` → `<dist>/gatOS/guest/` (High-importance
message when missing — fetch or build the guest first for an in-game-usable dist), and
`vendor/qemu/win-x64/**` when present. Destination: `GATOS_DIST_DIR` (CI) else the per-OS KSA
mods dir (`SelectedDistModDir` in `Directory.Build.props`). The managed payload is
wipe-cleaned each deploy; `guest/`+`qemu/` copy incrementally (`SkipUnchangedFiles`).

Every task ends with **both** the build and the test suite green. Keep test output minimal (no
Console spew from passing tests). Integration tests that need a real VM are gated by the `GATOS_IT=1`
env var and self-skip (`Assert.Ignore`) otherwise, so plain `dotnet test` never needs QEMU.
To run them locally: `guest/fetch-guest.sh` once (or build the image), have QEMU available —
on Linux/macOS a system install, on Windows run `tools/fetch-qemu.ps1` once (tests pick up
`vendor/qemu/win-x64/` automatically) — then `GATOS_IT=1 dotnet test gatos.slnx`
(PowerShell: `$env:GATOS_IT='1'; dotnet test gatos.slnx`). With `GATOS_IT=1`, missing prerequisites are hard failures,
not skips (see `gatOS.Vm.Tests/TestEnv.cs`); tests needing only `qemu-img` (DiskManager) also run
un-gated whenever QEMU is present. CI runs the full suite with `GATOS_IT=1` under KVM.

### Projects and the dependency rule

```
gatOS.Logging                    (no deps)            game-free logging shim
gatOS.NineP    → Logging                              9P2000.L codec + server (M7)
gatOS.SimFs    → NineP, Logging                       /sim node tree + snapshot store (M8)
gatOS.Vm       → Logging, Tomlyn                      QEMU lifecycle, disks, ports, GatOsPaths (M3, built)
gatOS.Ssh      → Vm, Logging, vendor/purrTTY, SSH.NET SshShellSession : ICustomShell (M4, built)
gatOS.GameMod  → Ssh, SimFs, Vm, Logging, vendor/purrTTY,
                  KSA DLLs, StarMap.API, Lib.Harmony, ModMenu.Attributes, Tomlyn   the KSA mod (M6, built)
```
Each library has a matching `*.Tests` NUnit project (`gatOS.GameMod` has none — it is game-coupled).

> **THE dependency rule (binding):** only `gatOS.GameMod` may reference KSA / Brutal / StarMap
> assemblies. Everything else must build and test on a bare host with no game DLLs present. This is
> what keeps the 9p server, VM manager and SSH session headlessly testable (mirrors purrTTY's
> backend/frontend discipline). KSA references in `GameMod` are condition-guarded
> (`Condition="Exists('$(KSAFolder)/…')"`) **and** its game-coupled sources (`Game/**`, the
> partial half of `Mod`) are compile-gated on `KSAFolder/KSA.dll`, so the whole solution —
> `GameMod` included — still builds when the assemblies are absent.

```
All host↔guest traffic is plain TCP over QEMU user-mode (slirp) networking — deliberately no
virtio-9p / virtiofs / vsock (none exist on Windows QEMU hosts). One transport, identical on every
host.

## Threading rules (binding for every task)

1. **Game state is read only on the game thread** (`[StarMapBeforeGui]`). The sampler builds an
   immutable `SimSnapshot` and publishes it with a single volatile reference swap.
2. **9p server threads never touch game state** — they read the latest published snapshot only.
3. SSH I/O runs on SSH.NET's threads; `OutputReceived` may fire on any thread (purrTTY tolerates
   this — its `Surface.Write` is the one thread-safe entrypoint).
4. `VmHost` is an async state machine guarded by one `SemaphoreSlim`; concurrent
   `EnsureStartedAsync` callers await the same in-flight boot task.
5. Nothing in gatOS ever blocks the render thread: menu/draw code reads cached state (volatile
   fields) only; all VM operations are async or background.

## Conventions (decided — do not re-litigate; see OS_PLAN.md Part 1)

- **.NET 10 / C# 13**, `Nullable enable`, `ImplicitUsings enable` (all from
  `Directory.Build.props`). **Zero-warning policy: no build warnings of any kind are allowed.**
  Compiler (CS) warnings are errors except CS1591, and `MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors` makes
  MSBuild-level warnings (e.g. MSB3277 reference-version conflicts) errors too. Fix the cause,
  never suppress: e.g. when a NuGet transitive pin conflicts with the KSA/purrTTY 10.x assemblies,
  lift it with a direct `PackageReference` in the project that owns the dependency (see SSH.NET →
  `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` 10.0.0 in `gatOS.Ssh.csproj`). Doc-comment `cref`s
  must resolve from the project's own references — use `<c>…</c>` for cross-assembly names a
  project doesn't reference.
- KSA reference DLLs resolve through `KSAFolder` (env `KSA_DLL_DIR` → sibling `ksa-game-assemblies`
  checkout → per-OS default), referenced with `<Private>false</Private>` and guarded by
  `Condition="Exists(...)"`.
- Mod deploy dir honors `GATOS_DIST_DIR` (CI zips it), else the per-OS KSA mods dir, producing
  `<dist>/gatOS/`. Runtime user-writable data lives under
  `MyDocuments/My Games/Kitten Space Agency/mods/gatOS/` — **centralized in `GatOsPaths`
  (`gatOS.Vm`); never hardcode filesystem locations elsewhere.**
- Logging: every game-free library logs through `gatOS.Logging`'s `ModLog` (Console-backed by
  default); `GameMod` swaps in a game-backed sink via `ModLog.SetLogger`. Never take a game-assembly
  dependency from a library project.
- Identity (D11): mod id/folder **`gatOS`**, entry assembly **`gatOS.GameMod`**, shell id
  **`"gatos"`**, guest hostname **`gatos`**.
- The vendored purrTTY contract DLLs (`vendor/purrTTY/`) are the **pinned inter-mod ABI** —
  refresh only deliberately (see `vendor/purrTTY/README.md`). At runtime gatOS shares purrTTY's
  loaded copies over the StarMap ALC (D6) via mod.toml `ImportedAssemblies` — the loader
  consults dependency-mod ALCs before the mod-local resolver. `GameMod` references them with
  `<Private>true</Private>` anyway: that puts the vendored copies in the dist **and** in
  deps.json (StarMap resolves a mod's own files through `AssemblyDependencyResolver`, which
  only sees deps.json entries), so gatOS still loads — registering into a registry nobody
  consumes — when purrTTY is absent.
- Commits: small, per-task, message starts with the task id (e.g. `T3.4: qemu readiness probe`).

## Instruction Maintenance Mandate (MUST)

Whenever you make meaningful repository changes, you MUST evaluate and update this file in the same
work item if it affects: project structure/dependencies, the host↔guest seam, build/test/deploy
commands, the threading rules, or **milestone/feature status**. As each milestone lands, move it
from "not yet implemented" to documented reality and add the concrete navigation pointers (class
names, files) — prefer verified code paths over the plan when documenting behavior. Remove defunct
guidance immediately. Do not document planned-but-unbuilt code as if it exists.
