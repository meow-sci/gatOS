# In-game validation record (OS_PLAN.md T6.6 / T6.7 / T9.3)

Manual pass results live here. Record machine, date, purrTTY/gatOS versions and the outcome of
each item; failures get a short note plus the relevant `logs/qemu-*.log` excerpt.

## M9 headless dist smoke (pre-validation; run 2026-06-12, Windows 11 game machine)

The M6 reflection harness, extended for M9, against the deployed dist (real VM boot, TCG):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `OnFullyLoaded` starts the 9p server (ephemeral loopback port) before any VM exists | ✅ |
| First session boot carries `gatos.simport=<port>`; the guest supervisor mounts `/sim` **unaided** (its connection appears during boot, before the prompt) | ✅ |
| `cat /sim/time/warp` through the real mount returns the published value | ✅ |
| `OnBeforeUi` ×5 headless: no throw escapes the hook (sampler runs or latches once) | ✅ |
| **Restart SimFs**: server bounced on the same port → guest re-establishes `/sim` by itself within seconds (`cat` works again, no manual umount) | ✅ |
| Unload: VM stop + 9p server stop, returned in 3.3 s | ✅ |

## Headless dist smoke (pre-validation; run 2026-06-12, Windows 11 game machine)

Before the first in-game pass, the deployed dist (`<MyDocuments>\My Games\Kitten Space
Agency\mods\gatOS`) was driven headlessly exactly as the game would — `Assembly.LoadFrom` of the
dist assemblies, lifecycle hooks invoked by reflection, the session opened through
`CustomShellRegistry` — proving everything below except the purrTTY/ModMenu UI layers:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `OnFullyLoaded`: asset validation OK (guest v1, bundled QEMU), first-run `gatos.toml` created | ✅ |
| Game logging absent → caught, stays on console (init not aborted) | ✅ |
| Shell `gatos` registered; purrTTY absence detected and logged once | ✅ |
| `CreateShell` → `StartAsync` boots the VM from dist assets (base install + overlay on first boot) | ✅ |
| WHPX attempt failed (HypervisorPlatform disabled) → classifier retried with TCG automatically | ✅ |
| Echo round-trip; `stty size` = launch size (30 100); live resize → 40 120 | ✅ |
| Session stop leaves the VM **Running** | ✅ |
| `Unload()` → QGA guest-shutdown, returned in 2.2 s | ✅ |

## T6.6 — In-game validation pass #1 (the M6 exit) — **NOT YET RUN**

Prereq: a purrTTY install carrying the T5.1/T5.2 changes (the purrTTY tip release cut is still
pending — see CLAUDE.md M5 note).

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | KSA launches with purrTTY (≥ T5.x release) + gatOS installed | ☐ | |
| 2 | purrTTY New Tab → **gatOS** → tab opens, boot, motd + root prompt | ☐ | TCG on this machine: expect ~7–10 s first boot |
| 3 | `stty size` matches the window; resizing the window updates it | ☐ | |
| 4 | `apk add htop` (real slirp network) → `htop` draws; Ctrl-C works | ☐ | |
| 5 | Second concurrent gatOS tab; closing tabs leaves the VM up (status window) | ☐ | |
| 6 | Quit game → qemu process gone, disk lock released | ☐ | |
| 7 | gatOS **without** purrTTY → game loads clean, one log line, no crash | ☐ | |

## T6.7 — Windows validation pass — **PARTIALLY COVERED HEADLESSLY**

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | WHP feature enabled: boot under WHPX, record boot time + accel | ☐ | `HypervisorPlatform` is currently **disabled** on the game machine (`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform`, admin + reboot) |
| 2 | WHP disabled: fallback lands on TCG, session usable, status window shows accel=tcg + DISM hint | ◐ | Fallback + usable session verified headlessly 2026-06-12 (WHPX "Unexpected VP exit code 4" → forced-tcg retry); the status-window hint itself needs the in-game pass |
| 3 | Full T6.6 checklist on Windows | ☐ | |

## T9.3 — In-game validation pass #2 (the M9 exit) — **NOT YET RUN**

Prereq: the T6.6 pass (purrTTY tip release). Run during a real flight with at least one vessel.

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ls /sim/vessels/by-id/` lists the loaded vessels | ☐ | |
| 2 | `watch -n1 cat /sim/vessels/active/altitude/radar` live during a flight; Ctrl-C clean | ☐ | |
| 3 | `tail -f /sim/vessels/active/stream \| jq .alt.radar` streams; Ctrl-C clean | ☐ | needs `apk add jq` |
| 4 | `cat /sim/events` during a launch shows situation changes; warp change → `warp-changed` | ☐ | |
| 5 | Time-warp changes `/sim/time/warp`; `/sim/time/ut` advances faster under warp | ☐ | |
| 6 | Status window: SimFs row shows port + 1 connection while the VM is up | ☐ | |
| 7 | Menu → Restart SimFs → guest re-establishes `/sim` within ~4 s (verified headlessly ✅) | ◐ | headless 2026-06-12: same-port rebind + unaided remount |
| 8 | Orbit dir appears for an orbiting vessel; apoapsis is an altitude (not a radius) | ☐ | |
| 9 | Battery/tanks/engines dirs match the vessel; values move during a burn | ☐ | |

## G1 — Control-surface validation pass — **NOT YET RUN**

Prereq: the T6.6 pass (purrTTY tip release). Run during a real flight with a vessel that has at
least one engine and one deployable solar panel. `[control] enabled = true` (default). See
`docs/KSA_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md` for the full path/anchor list.

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `echo 1 > /sim/vessels/active/ctl/ignite` ignites the active stage (exit 0) | ☐ | |
| 2 | `echo 1 > /sim/vessels/active/ctl/shutdown` shuts engines down | ☐ | |
| 3 | `echo 0 > /sim/vessels/active/engines/0/active` toggles one engine; read-back reflects it | ☐ | |
| 4 | `echo 1 > /sim/vessels/active/ctl/lights` / `echo 0 …` toggles vessel lights | ☐ | |
| 5 | `echo 1 > /sim/vessels/active/solar/0/goal` deploys a panel; `0` retracts it | ☐ | |
| 6 | `echo 0.5 > /sim/vessels/active/animations/0/goal` drives an animation to mid-travel | ☐ | |
| 7 | `echo bogus > …/engines/0/active` fails with EINVAL (nonzero exit, "Invalid argument") | ☐ | verified via `GATOS_IT` fixture ✅ |
| 8 | `[control] enabled=false` → every write fails EACCES | ☐ | |
| 9 | `cat /sim/status/transports` shows the 9p port + `control on`; `/sim/status/game_version` non-empty | ☐ | |
| 10 | A deliberately broken accessor surfaces in `/sim/status/accessors` and the rest keeps working | ☐ | health-latch path |

## G3 / G4 — read-surface & full-control validation pass — **NOT YET RUN**

Prereq: the T6.6 pass (purrTTY tip release). Read surface verified over the managed 9p client
(`SimFsTreeTests`, `EventDifferTests`, `FormatsTests`) and the control surface over the client
(`ControlSurfaceTests`); these are the in-guest spot-checks. `[control] debug_namespace = true`
(default) for the debug rows. See `docs/KSA_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md` for the full path/anchor list.

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cat /sim/system/sun` names the star; `ls /sim/bodies` lists planets/moons + the star | ☐ | |
| 2 | `cat /sim/bodies/<planet>/{radius,mu,soi}` and `…/atmosphere/sea_level_pressure` are sane | ☐ | |
| 3 | `cat /sim/vessels/active/telemetry \| jq .orbit.ap` returns the apoapsis (one atomic read) | ☐ | |
| 4 | `cat /sim/vessels/active/navball/{pitch,twr,deltav}` track the in-game NavBall | ☐ | |
| 5 | `cat /sim/vessels/active/environment/{pressure,density,g_force}` move during ascent/reentry | ☐ | |
| 6 | `echo TARGET > /sim/time/alarm; cat /sim/time/alarm` blocks until sim time reaches TARGET | ☐ | verified over 9p client ✅ |
| 7 | `echo 0.5 > …/ctl/throttle` sets throttle; NavBall/engines reflect it near 1× warp | ☐ | reflection path (High churn) |
| 8 | `echo 1 > …/ctl/stage` activates the next stage | ☐ | |
| 9 | `echo prograde > …/ctl/attitude_mode` then the autopilot holds prograde; `manual` releases | ☐ | |
| 10 | `echo "0 0 0 1" > …/ctl/attitude_target` / `echo "<ut> <dvx> <dvy> <dvz>" > …/ctl/burn` set FC targets | ☐ | |
| 11 | `echo 1 > …/ctl/rcs` and `…/rcs/<n>/active` toggle RCS | ☐ | |
| 12 | `echo "1 0 0" > …/lights/0/color` recolours only that light (per-instance clone) | ☐ | High churn |
| 13 | `echo 1 > …/decouplers/0/fire` fires once; a second write returns EBUSY | ☐ | |
| 14 | `echo 50 > /sim/debug/time/warp` sets warp; `echo other > /sim/debug/switch_vessel` switches control | ☐ | |
| 15 | `echo 1 > /sim/debug/vessels/<id>/refill_battery` tops the battery (solver-phase drain) | ☐ | |
| 16 | `echo "<px py pz vx vy vz>" > /sim/debug/vessels/<id>/teleport` moves the vessel; no NaN glitch | ☐ | |
| 17 | `[control] debug_namespace=false` → `/sim/debug` is absent | ☐ | verified over 9p client ✅ |
